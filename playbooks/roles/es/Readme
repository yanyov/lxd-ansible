Ansible role that will install elasticsearch.
To change the verion of elasticsearch change variable elasticsearch_pkg_version.
In our role default/main.yml we use version 5.6.3:
elasticsearch_pkg_version: "elasticsearch=5.6.3"

To install xpack you need to set:
elasticsearch_xpack: true (by default is false)
You also need to have separate certs for every elasticsearch server. The certs are located in - files/certs/(dev/sit - or any other environment).
For certs use following varibles:
- elasticsearch_ssl_private_key
- elasticsearch_ssl_cert
- elasticsearch_ssl_ca

To create cluster use:
- role: es
  vars:
    elasticsearch_cluster: ["es1", "es2", "es3"]
where es1, es2, es3 are our elasticsearch nodes.
